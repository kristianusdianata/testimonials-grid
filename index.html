              I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
              current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel
              I got every penny&apos;s worth.

                &quot;I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
                I&apos;ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some
                people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the
                free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
                shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
                grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course,
                I&apos;ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software
                Engineer at a VR startup.&quot;

              Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
              Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
              easy.

                &quot; The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress

                present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is
                above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need

                &quot; Before joining the bootcamp, I&apos;ve never written a
                line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can
                help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to
                enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful
                things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did
                not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait
                long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
                outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that
                no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I&apos;ve often referred
                to it during interviews as an example of my developent
                experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
                developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!
